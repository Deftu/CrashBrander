## Why?
Debugging modpacks is difficult, and a fair bit of difficulty comes from varying modpack versions, and users using outdated versions of modpacks. This mod fixes that by allowing modpacks to include their name, version and support link directly inside the crash report!

Not only will these small debug additions help diagnose things in support, but it also adds the ability to slightly automate support by using things such as Discord bots.
